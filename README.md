# Our own custom images for [itopia Spaces](https://itopiaSpaces.com)

[These open-source container images](https://github.com/orgs/itopia-inc/packages?repo_name=spaces-custom-images)
define custom spaces that our teams use for their daily work.
This repo also acts as an example/demonstration for how any Spaces user
can define & maintain their own custom spaces,
based on the [base](https://github.com/itopia-inc/spaces-base-images)
and [pre-configured](https://github.com/itopia-inc/spaces-images) images.
